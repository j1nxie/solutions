# Exercise 01

Below is a sequence of expressions. What is the result printed by the
interpreter in response to each expressions? Assume that the sequence is to be
evaluated in the order in which it is presented.

First line is the original given expression, second line is its output.

```racket
10
10

(+ 5 3 4)
12

(- 9 1)
8

(/ 6 2)
3

(+ (* 2 4) (- 4 6))
6

(define a 3)
; nothing

(define b (+ a 1))
; nothing

(+ a b (* a b))
19

(= a b)
#f

(if (and (> b a) (< b (* a b)))
	b
	a)
4

(cond ((= a 4) 6)
	  ((= b 4) (+ 6 7 a))
	  (else 25))
16

(+ 2 (if (> b a) b a))
6

(* (cond ((> a b) a)
		 ((< a b) b)
		 (else - 1))
   (+ a 1))
